  "description": "The comic adventures of 48 Truth Alights, a stone angel who participated in the War for Rayuba on the side of Bastion. 48 quickly becomes entangled with the path of fellow Bastion healer Fog of Graves, and seeks to avenge the curse put on his friend.\n\n(War for Rayuba was an \"original character tournament\" where artists would design characters and pit them against each other in comic form. While there were 9 total rounds of War for Rayuba, I only participated in three of them. In the first round, I went head-to-head with Bumbleklutz (the artist for Mnem), and though we both drew opposing comics the judges preferred Bumble's. In this collection, I included my own comic (The Early Bird) as well as Bumble's (The Pangs of Joy Behind), even though only Bumble's is canon to the later comics.)",
